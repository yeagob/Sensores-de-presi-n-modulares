*All functions were used and tested in Unity3D Pro version 3.5.7f6

To use this product:

1.) At the top of any script that you will be using these custom
	functions (similar to the standard: using UnityEngine;) add:
	using ArrayUtilities;
	
	a.) ArrayUtilities provides the user an assortment of functions to 
		manipulate arrays much like Javascript has built in.  Also,
		the pro version of ArrayUtilities has many more array manipulation
		features such as randomly shuffling the array, check whether two
		arrays are equal, shiftStack which allows the user to move a range
		of array indices anywhere within that array and many more that the 
		uses and syntax can be found within the arrayTests.cs script.
		
2.) All examples of syntax can be found within the arrayTests script.
